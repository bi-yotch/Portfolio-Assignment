    Hello! I'm
    <nobr class="animated" style="font-size:100px; font-family: Arial;font-weight:900;">SYEDA ZAINAB</nobr>
    <br/><br/>
    I'm currently studying for a Computer Science degree in University of Wollongong, Dubai. I was born in India, my native place, and raised in the Middle East.
    I shifted to Dubai in the June of 2019. Before that, I lived in Kuwait for 11 years and then in Saudi Arabia for 6 years. I have a passion for coding, poetry,
    leadership, friends and family.
    <br/><br/>
    I became interested in the field of Computer Science in the start of my high school. I had taken up the subject
    solely because my favourite teacher taught it. With time, I was introduced to coding and was truly amazed by the possibility of creating programs which would
    work the way we want it to. So Computer Science was no more just a 'subject' I studied in school, it became a hobby and a part of my daily routine. For a start,
    I coded programs to the best of my imagination and those which would help my brother with his Math homework. Over the span of two years, I realized that for a
    practical and logical personality, such as mine, coding and Computer Science would best suit me for a career.

    <br/>
    Along with coding, I have discovered other fields of interest such as in poetry, sports, leadership and public speaking. My school years have been more than just academics;
    I've actively taken part in various intra-school as well as inter-school events. The best of my achievements would be, being felicitated as the Head Girl in my 12th
    grade and representing my school in CBSE Nationals in the academic year 2018-19.
